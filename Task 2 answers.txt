1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increases?
When the number of hidden nodes in the neural network increases, the model generally becomes better at learning complex patterns in the data. With a very small number of hidden nodes, such as 1 to 3, the network tends to underfit, resulting in low accuracy and overly simple decision boundaries. Increasing the hidden layer size to a moderate range, around 5 to 20 nodes, usually improves accuracy significantly, as the model can represent more complex and non-linear relationships. However, beyond a certain point, such as 50 or more nodes, the accuracy often shows little to no improvement, and in some cases, the model may overfit, especially when working with smaller datasets.

2. Pattern of the accuracy change
The accuracy typically increases rapidly as the number of hidden nodes grows from very small to moderate values, since the network gains more capacity to capture patterns in the data. Once the hidden layer size reaches a sufficient level to model the underlying patterns, the accuracy tends to plateau, meaning additional nodes do not significantly boost performance. In some cases, adding too many hidden nodes can even hurt generalization, as the model starts memorizing the training data instead of learning features that work well on unseen data.
