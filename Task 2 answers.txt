1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increases?
With very few hidden nodes (e.g., 1–3), the model is underfitting — accuracy is low, and the decision boundary is too simple.

As hidden nodes increase (e.g., 5–20), the accuracy improves — the model can capture more complex patterns.

Beyond a certain number (e.g., 50+), accuracy may not improve much or may fluctuate due to overfitting or training instability.

2. Pattern of the accuracy change
Accuracy tends to increase rapidly with hidden size up to a certain point.

After a certain hidden size, the accuracy plateaus — extra nodes don’t help much.

If the dataset is small, too many hidden nodes can lead to overfitting — the model memorizes training data but may not generalize.
